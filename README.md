## What is TonePoem?
TonePoem is a collaborative effort to create a comprehensive and well-classified database of sounds using a concise list of adjectives. There are few tagged databases of sounds, and of those that are documented, the tags are exclusively literal descriptions. Audio tagging is an important task to be able to predict the tags of audio clips. This is only possible with thoroughly tagged audio-database.<br>
With TonePoem, users can explore the audio space, listen to a short audio clip and choose from the word wheel the best adjective that is associated with the audio. They will also be able to view what other people think is the best adjective describing the sound!<br>
The goal of the project is to create a classified database of sounds with abstract labels which can be used in further machine learning applications.
